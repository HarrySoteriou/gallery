Embedding Models - Vector Representations for AI

Embedding models convert discrete objects like words, sentences, images, or documents into dense vector representations that capture semantic meaning and relationships in a continuous space.

Types of Embeddings:

1. Word Embeddings:
   - Word2Vec: Skip-gram and CBOW architectures for learning word representations
   - GloVe: Global vectors for word representation using co-occurrence statistics
   - FastText: Subword information for handling out-of-vocabulary words
   - ELMo: Contextualized embeddings using bidirectional LSTM

2. Sentence and Document Embeddings:
   - Sentence-BERT (SBERT): BERT-based sentence embeddings for semantic similarity
   - Universal Sentence Encoder: Google's model for sentence-level embeddings
   - Doc2Vec: Extension of Word2Vec for document-level representations
   - InferSent: Supervised learning of sentence representations

3. Transformer-based Embeddings:
   - BERT embeddings: Contextualized word and sentence representations
   - RoBERTa: Robustly optimized BERT pretraining approach
   - ALBERT: A lite BERT for self-supervised learning

   - Next sentence prediction
   - Contrastive predictive coding
   - SimCSE for sentence embeddings

Key Properties:
- Dimensionality: Typically 128, 256, 512, 768, or 1024 dimensions
- Cosine similarity: Standard metric for comparing embeddings
- Semantic clustering: Similar concepts cluster in embedding space
- Linear relationships: Analogies preserved in vector arithmetic

Applications:

1. Information Retrieval:
   - Semantic search engines
